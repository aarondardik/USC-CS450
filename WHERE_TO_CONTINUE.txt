FIRST OF ALL:

Once the exam is over...
Before continuing working on the program go through the spec once again...
Make sure to download the latest version of the spec from the website.


WHERE TO CONTINUE:

Remember, look at the graph that I drew... Basically, phase 1 and
phase 2 are done. Now phase 3 is to "let the client know if some students don't
exist by the list provided by it".

So for that phase, I simply have to send the message to user (regardless if
the user there are students that don't exist ot not). Maybe one idea could be
that if there are 0 students that don't exist, then simply send a message
with size 0.

Of course I have to implement all the sending functionality in serverM.c
because it still does not have... HOWEVER it should be very straightforward
since I already have the code in clientM.c, so maybe just few modificatin will
be required.


SOME QUESTION TO ASK TO TA AMANDA OR IN PIAZZA:

--> Can you provide us with more test cases?
    Also, the sample run of the program that is provided in the spec does not
    match with the CE.txt and EE.txt files that are provided. For example, in the
    client terminal it says that luis dies not exist but it is present in
    EE.txt. Also, bob is not neither in CE.txt nor in EE.txt but it the sample
    run it says that bob exist.

    Again, more test cases would be great.

--> Make sure about the algorithm that we have to implement.

    Does the final result sent to the user the intntersection of all the
    students? Or partial intersections must also sent to the user?

--> Make sure that A is CE and B is EE.

--> Let her know that since [1,1] is not allowed in the input, then
    something like [17,17] should not be allowed in the output.

    I think the correct whay to respresent an interval of only 1 course in
    the input would be something like:

        [[4,8],[11],[17,18]] where [11] means that there is only one course.

    And the same will be in the output.

    My point here is that something like:

    [[4,8],[11,11],[17,18]] in NOT correct neither in the input nor in the
    output, right?
